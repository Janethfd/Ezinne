### 🌟 Full-Stack Engineer | Technical Lead | Multi-Disciplinary Professional 🌟

I am a highly analytical and results-driven professional specializing in complex systems architecture, quality assurance, and strategic data analysis. With a unique background spanning the **entire software development lifecycle (SDLC)**, I excel at transforming business requirements into secure, scalable solutions—from the network layer up to the user interface.

My core strength is bridging the gap between engineering execution, quality oversight, and project delivery, ensuring efficiency and excellence in every deployment.
